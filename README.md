## 🔍 Overview

Clinical research involving rare diseases often requires multi-site collaboration, due to low disease prevalence and logistical complexity. This repository provides a unified optimisation framework for:

- Patient recruitment across multiple healthcare providers
- Sample allocation to analytical laboratories
- Platform selection based on biomarker coverage and cost
- Minimising logistics burden through local sample processing
- Incorporating clinical interest and diagnostic confidence

The framework uses **cardinality-constrained optimisation** to ensure transparent, fair, and cost-efficient clinical study design.
